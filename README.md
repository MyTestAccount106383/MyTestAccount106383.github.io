NOTICE: Workflow to automatically update date/time is **disabled**. Must reenable before use. (Actions tab)<br>
Using workflows allows a python script to save data to github servers, but they take a few minutes to update to github, which is not good enough.<br>
-^^^ Try a loop on the website to call readTextFile repeatedly?<br>
-Additionally, I have not yet found a way to allow the script to save data whilst running. The script must end, meaning no while loops to continuously update info yet.<br>
It is possible to have a project's website read information from a file within the same project, that seems to have gone smoothly so far.<br>

## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/MyTestAccount106383/MyTestAccount106383.github.io/edit/main/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/MyTestAccount106383/MyTestAccount106383.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
